# About
Implementation of Reynolds boids algorithm, with behaviors separation, cohesion, alignment, obstacle avoidance and fleeing from predators. This was a project in Sub Symbolic AI methods at [NTNU] spring 2015. For a live example, see the [github pages] site.

# Credits to processing.js
This implementation does not make use of the [processing.js] library. However, the implementation borrows elements from their [flocking example]. A big thank you to them.

# Checking out the code
A good place to start is animation.js, as this is where the main program loop resides.
